# Apple may release six different iPhone 12 models in 2020

As to why Apple would release six iPhone 12 models next year, it all comes down to 5G. According to Zhang, most iPhone 12 models will come in two variants — one with 4G and one with 5G. It sounds a bit far fetched at first glance, but might actually make sense given that 5G coverage still isn’t anywhere close to being all-encompassing.

Sprint’s 5G coverage, for example, only includes 9 U.S. cities at the moment. Suffice it to say, many consumers will not be happy about paying a premium for 5G when they can’t take advantage of it.

That said, Zhang anticipates that Apple’s new iPhone 12 lineup will look like this:


iPhone 12 4G with a 6.1-inch LCD screen and dual rear cameras

iPhone 12 Pro 4G with a 5.4-inch OLED screen and dual rear cameras

iPhone 12 Pro 5G with a 5.4-inch OLED display and dual rear cameras

iPhone 12 Pro Plus 4G with a 6.1-inch OLED display and a triple rear camera with Time-of-Flight 3D sensing capabilities

iPhone 12 Pro Plus 5G using a 6.1-inch OLED screen, triple camera setup, and ToF features

iPhone 12 Pro Max 5G with a 6.7-inch OLED panel, the triple camera setup, and ToF.
